# Fake Shopping Sites

## What Happens
You find an amazing deal online – prices too good to be true. You pay, and the item never arrives. The site was fake.

## How to Spot a Fake Site
- Domain name has extra words (like "best-deals-2026.com").
- No physical address or working phone number.
- Poor grammar and spelling.
- Requests payment by wire transfer or cryptocurrency.

## What to Do
**Stick to well‑known sites.** If you try a new site, search for reviews with the word "scam" before buying. Pay with credit card – you can dispute fraudulent charges.
