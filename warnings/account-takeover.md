# Account Takeover – When Someone Steals Your Email

## What Happens
A hacker gets into your email. They reset passwords for your other accounts and lock you out.

## How to Protect Yourself
1. **Use a strong, unique password** for your email – it's the key to everything.
2. **Turn on 2FA** for your email.
3. **Check your email settings** occasionally for forwarding rules you didn't create (thieves sometimes hide copies of your mail).

## What to Do If Hacked
1. Try "forgot password" to regain access.
2. Contact the email provider's support.
3. Check your bank and other accounts for unusual activity.
