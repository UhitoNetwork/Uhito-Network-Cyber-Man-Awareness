# How to Join the Awareness Program

Becoming part of Uhito Network's awareness effort is simple, but it requires responsibility.

## Step 1: Protect Yourself First
Read through this entire repository. Apply the warnings and guides to your own life. Get certified if you plan to give public advice.

## Step 2: Help Your Inner Circle
Start with family and close friends. Warn them about current scams. Show them how to turn on 2FA. Document what you do (without sharing private details).

## Step 3: Share Your Experience
Email us at **uhitonetwork@gmail.com** and tell us:
- What you did
- How people reacted
- What worked well
- What was difficult

We'll give you feedback and may feature your story in `success-stories.md`.

## Step 4: Run a Workshop
Use the `campaigns/workshop-guide.md` to organize a small community session. It can be at a local library, community center, or even a family gathering.

## Step 5: Become a Cyber-Man
If you consistently help and follow ethics, we may invite you to officially represent Uhito Network. This means you'll get early access to new materials and be listed as a trusted contact (with your permission).
