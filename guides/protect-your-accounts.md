# Protect Your Online Accounts

## Use Strong Passwords
- Long (at least 12 characters)
- Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Different for every account

## Use a Password Manager
A password manager remembers all your passwords for you. You only need one master password. Examples: Bitwarden (free), Keepass (free), or the one built into your browser.

## Turn on Two‑Factor Authentication (2FA)
This adds a second step when you log in – usually a code from an app or SMS. Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the code.

**How to turn it on:**
1. Go to your account security settings.
2. Look for "Two‑Factor Authentication" or "2FA."
3. Choose an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) for the best security.
4. Follow the steps to set it up.

## Check Your Accounts Regularly
- Look at your bank and email for anything unusual.
- Remove apps or devices you don't recognize.
- Update recovery email and phone number.

**If you see something strange, change your password immediately.**
