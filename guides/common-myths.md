# Common Myths About Online Safety

## Myth 1: "I'm not important enough to hack."
**Truth:** Hackers use automated tools that scan millions of accounts. They don't target you personally – they target easy victims. Everyone is a target.

## Myth 2: "Antivirus software is enough."
**Truth:** Antivirus helps, but it can't stop you from giving away your password or clicking a malicious link. You are the best defense.

## Myth 3: "Using the same password everywhere is fine if it's strong."
**Truth:** One strong password stolen from a shady website can be used to break into your email, bank, and social media. Always use different passwords.

## Myth 4: "Incognito mode keeps me private."
**Truth:** Incognito only stops your browser from saving history. Your internet provider, employer, and the websites you visit can still see you.

## Myth 5: "If a message looks real, it must be real."
**Truth:** Scammers copy logos and emails perfectly. Always verify through official channels.
