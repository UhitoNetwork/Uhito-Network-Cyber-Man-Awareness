# CYBER-MAN ETHICS

## Rules They Follow

### Core Rules:
1. **Certification First** – Never help beyond your certified knowledge
2. **Legal Always** – Break no laws, even to help
3. **Transparency** – Be clear about your qualifications
4. **Safety Focus** – Protect, don't show off technical skills
5. **Community Trust** – Earn it through consistent, safe help

### Daily Ethics Check:
- "Am I staying within my certified limits?"
- "Is this action legal and authorized?"
- "Will this make people safer or just show what I know?"
- "Am I being transparent about what I can and cannot do?"

### When in Doubt:
1. **Stop** – Don't proceed
2. **Refer** – Send to certified professional
3. **Document** – Note the situation for learning
4. **Learn** – Study the gap in your knowledge

### The Promise:
> "I use my certified knowledge only for protection.
> I speak simply so everyone understands.
> I follow laws even when inconvenient.
> I protect community trust as carefully as I protect data."
