# The Gift Card Request

Fatima received a message on Facebook from her friend "Hassan." He said he was in trouble and needed her to buy gift cards and send the codes. She wanted to help.

She bought $200 worth of gift cards and sent the codes.

Later she learned Hassan's account was hacked. The messages were from a scammer.

**How to avoid this:**
- Call your friend directly to verify.
- Never buy gift cards for someone you can't talk to.
- Gift cards are for gifts, not payments.

**If a friend asks for money online, always check by phone or in person first.**
