# The Lost Phone

Karim lost his phone on the bus. He was worried about the cost of a new one, but he thought his data was safe – he had a password.

The person who found it couldn't guess his password, but the SIM card was unprotected. They put the SIM in another phone and reset passwords for his email and social media using "forgot password" texts.

Karim lost access to everything.

**What he could have done:**
- Set a SIM PIN (a separate code for the SIM card).
- Use an authentication app instead of SMS for 2FA.
- Call his phone company immediately to block the SIM.

**Lesson:** A phone password protects the device, but a SIM PIN protects your number.
